    "# Understanding Robo-Advisor Risk Assessment Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how robo-advisors assess client risk profiles and translate them into investment recommendations. The process involves collecting client information through questionnaires, calculating risk scores, and mapping these scores to appropriate asset allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, during new client registration on robo-platforms, clients fill out a form known as **KYC form** (*Know Your Client* form).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Risk Assessment Factors\n",
    "The model considers five key dimensions that academic research and industry practice have identified as crucial for determining appropriate investment strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **Investment Experience** (Scale 1-5)\n",
    "- Measures familiarity with financial markets\n",
    "- Higher experience suggests greater capacity to understand and accept investment risk\n",
    "- Contributes positively to risk score\n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Investment Horizon** (1-20 years)\n",
    "- Longer horizons allow for more risk-taking due to:\n",
    " - More time to recover from market downturns\n",
    " - Greater ability to capture equity risk premium\n",
    "- Normalized to 1-5 scale in calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Income Stability** (Scale 1-5)\n",
    "- Measures predictability of income streams\n",
    "- Higher stability (5) enables more risk-taking because:\n",
    " - More reliable cash flows for living expenses\n",
    " - Less likely to need emergency liquidation of investments\n",
    " - Greater ability to weather market downturns\n",
    "- Score is inverted in calculation as higher stability supports higher risk capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "d) **Risk Tolerance** (Scale 1-5)\n",
    "- Psychological ability to accept investment volatility\n",
    "- Behavioral component distinct from risk capacity\n",
    "- Direct measure of willingness to accept potential losses\n",
    "\n",
    "e) **Investment Knowledge** (Scale 1-5)\n",
    "- Understanding of financial markets and principles\n",
    "- Higher knowledge correlates with better decision-making during market stress\n",
    "- Contributes positively to risk score\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Scoring Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk score calculation involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization**:\n",
    "  - Investment horizon converted from 1-20 years to 1-5 scale\n",
    "  - Income stability inverted (5→1, 4→2, etc.) to align with risk capacity\n",
    "  - Other factors used directly on 1-5 scale\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted Average**:\n",
    "  - Default weights:\n",
    "    - Investment Experience: 20%\n",
    "    - Investment Horizon: 20%\n",
    "    - Income Stability: 20%\n",
    "    - Risk Tolerance: 25%\n",
    "    - Investment Knowledge: 15%\n",
    "  - Weights are adjustable through interactive sliders\n",
    "  - Sum of weights normalized to 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Score**:\n",
    "  - Weighted average rounded to nearest integer\n",
    "  - Bounded between 1-5\n",
    "  - Maps to risk profiles from Conservative (1) to Aggressive (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Asset Allocation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk scores map to these allocation models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conservative (Score 1)**:\n",
    "  - 20% Stocks, 70% Bonds, 10% Cash\n",
    "  - Focus on capital preservation\n",
    "  - Suitable for short horizons or very low risk tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moderately Conservative (Score 2)**:\n",
    "  - 40% Stocks, 55% Bonds, 5% Cash\n",
    "  - Limited growth with stability\n",
    "  - Suitable for shorter-medium horizons\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moderate (Score 3)**:\n",
    "  - 60% Stocks, 35% Bonds, 5% Cash\n",
    "  - Balanced growth and stability\n",
    "  - Suitable for medium-term horizons\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Moderately Aggressive (Score 4)**:\n",
    "  - 75% Stocks, 20% Bonds, 5% Cash\n",
    "  - Growth emphasis with some stability\n",
    "  - Suitable for longer horizons\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Aggressive (Score 5)**:\n",
    "  - 90% Stocks, 10% Bonds, 0% Cash\n",
    "  - Maximum growth focus\n",
    "  - Suitable for longest horizons and highest risk tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interactive Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation includes:\n",
    "- Sliders for all input factors\n",
    "- Adjustable factor weights\n",
    "- Real-time updates of:\n",
    " - Risk score calculation\n",
    " - Profile description\n",
    " - Asset allocation visualization\n",
    "- Detailed output showing calculation components\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Foundation and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "This model builds on several key theoretical frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**:\n",
    "  - Asset allocations based on efficient frontier concepts\n",
    "  - Risk-return tradeoff optimization\n",
    "  - Diversification benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavioral Finance**:\n",
    "  - Recognition of psychological factors in risk tolerance\n",
    "  - Separation of risk capacity from risk tolerance\n",
    "  - Consideration of behavioral biases\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Life-Cycle Investing**:\n",
    "  - Age and horizon considerations\n",
    "  - Human capital factors (income stability)\n",
    "  - Time diversification principles\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Financial Planning Best Practices**:\n",
    "  - Holistic assessment of client situation\n",
    "  - Multiple factor consideration\n",
    "  - Regular rebalancing implied\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Questionnaire Limitations**:\n",
    "  - Self-reported data may be biased\n",
    "  - Risk tolerance can change with market conditions\n",
    "  - Simplified measures of complex characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Simplifications**:\n",
    "  - Linear scoring model\n",
    "  - Discrete risk profiles\n",
    "  - Limited asset classes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation Considerations**:\n",
    "  - Need for regular updates\n",
    "  - Market condition impacts\n",
    "  - Individual circumstances not captured\n",
    "\n",
